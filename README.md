ofxImGui_v3
=============================

## Notes by @moebiusSurfing:

![Alt text](screenshot.PNG?raw=true "screenshot")  

**This is a fork from**  
https://github.com/yumataesu/ofxImGui_v3

### Why to use this fork?
Simpler and easy to update than the ´official´:  
https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui  
My main idea here is to have some helper methods useful for openFrameworks, mainly to handle ´ofParameter/ofParameterGroup´.  
I will try to use ofxImGuiSimple or ofxImGui_v3.  
I will add some interesting links.  

### Updated to  
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.77  

### Thanks to  
**@yumataesu** -> for the original code!  
And thanks all other coders or the all below links.  

### Tested System  
**OF 0.11 / Windows10 / VS2017**  

### TODO
- Add node patching repositories.  
- Collect all helpers on the same place.
